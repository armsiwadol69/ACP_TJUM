		<h3>JOGO JJJ Family </h3>
		<p><br/><em>CSS inheritance</em> is the last piece we need to investigate to get all the
		information and understand what style is applied to an element. The idea is that some property
		values applied to an element will be inheritance by that element's children, and some won't.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>For exemple, it makes sense for font-family and color to be inheritance, as that makes it
		easy for you to set a site-wide base font by applying a font-family to the <html> element; you
		can then override the fonts on individual elements where needed. It would be really annoying
		to have to set the base font separately on every element.</li>
		<li>As another exemple, it makes sense for margin, pedding, border, and background-image to
		NOT be inherited. Imagine the styling/layout mess that would occur if you set these properties
		on a container element and had them inherited by every single child element, and than had to
		unset them all on each individual element!</li>
