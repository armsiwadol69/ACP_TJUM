    <h1>Sussurro [苏苏洛]</h1>
    <h3>She will strictly follow the operator guidelines when providing medical assistance. <br>
Sussurro, Medic of Rhodes Island, is on standby to provide first aid at the front.</h3>
    <p>Sussurro is a graduate of the Siracusa-Palermo Medical Academy. She has a sufficient level of knowledge in basic medical care.
She is now a medic at Rhodes Island and is a respected member of the headquarters' logistics system.</p>
<h3>Archive File 1</h3>
<p>Sussurro was born to an ordinary family in a large city in Siracusa. Her parents were ordinary citizens who worked in local public institutions. They had two sons and two daughters. Sussurro was their third child.
Although Sussurro's parents wanted her to be a quiet, obedient child, she did not respond positively to these expectations. Sometimes this was to help her younger sister get back snacks her brothers had stolen, and sometimes this was to help her sister get a hold of a toy she couldn't have. Since her childhood, Sussurro has developed a personality that takes initiative.
Sussurro's two older brothers have already grown up and have gone into business. Her younger sister is studying in kindergarten. Sussurro herself chose to study medicine. She did not do so out of any grand ambition or dream, but because the medical industry in Siracusa holds promise and is a good field to work in.</p>

<p>Sussurro's life as a medical student was uneventful. She busied herself preparing for exams and participating in experiments. Her small figure was often bouncing between the different buildings on campus, and her short stature notwithstanding, all of her abilities steadily progressed.
Luckily for Sussurro, she got to make a solid group of friends between classes and maintained good relationships with some older students. These medical students all embraced the same dreams, confronted the same challenges, and worked towards the future together. With everyone's help and encouragement, Sussurro managed to press on through the long, dull days in her time as a medical student.
Though Sussurro originally had no aspirations of her own, through making friends with all kinds of people, she gradually came to understand the reasoning behind their choices. Whether it was to secure a job with a stable salary and life environment, out of a genuine desire to help others, or just out of pure interest in biology, Sussurro found their aspirations infectious. She liked everyone who had a dream and worked hard to fulfill it, and at the same time, her own thinking became clear:
Does becoming a doctor hold any special meaning for me?</p>

<p>When the oripathy crisis gradually worsened throughout every major city, people were forced to confront an all-new and unknown illness. Now, both public and private hospitals were packed with patients, and medical resources became strained. Sussurro's clinical instructor as well as her seniors all participated in efforts to combat the disease.
Faced with a notice that all major hospitals were recruiting medical students to act as volunteers, Sussurro did not think twice about signing up. It was at this moment that she felt she was finally a medical student, and she found genuine purpose.</p>
<h3>Archive File 4</h3>
<p>Sussurro did not think about the fact that she had become infected by volunteering to participate in the treatment of the infected. Even when three days had passed since she herself had been transformed from doctor to infected, she did not feel anything. Everything just seemed to happen so suddenly.
It wasn't until she witnessed a patient be declared untreatable and get sent to the intensive care unit with a blank stare that she made the connection between herself and the situation at hand.</p>
