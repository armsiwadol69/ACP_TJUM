        <h1>Operator Overview</h1>
        <h2>“Don't worry, my poison is not contagious.”</h2>
        <pre align="left">
          <h3>Blue Poison (BP) is a lovely girl with a terrifying ability. She was recruited by Rhodes Island due to her natural talent in creating toxins.
Now she serves as a Sniper operator and attacks enemies with poisoned darts. She’s able to deliver DPS, attack multiple targets and even deal Arts damage with her toxins.
BP’s talent Neurotoxin allows her to poison her targets, causing them to take Arts damage over time. This is especially useful when combined with BP’s Skills,
which allow her to hit multiple enemies at once. Her first Skill, Twinshot - Auto, deals additional damage and hits 2 targets.
Her aforementioned Talent combined with the Skill's extremely low SP Cost makes it a powerful tool for sustained damage. Blue Poison’s second skill is Venom Spray,
an active Skill that allows her to hit up to 3 enemies at once, enabling even greater multi-target damage potential.

BP's ability to hit multiple enemies and deal Arts damage at the DP cost of an ST sniper makes her a great value pick. However, Blue Poison is not without downsides.
She isn’t very flexible in terms of her role, as both of her skills have similar uses. And since she has no burst skill,
she might have problems when dealing with stronger waves of enemies.
Used in the proper situations, however, Blue Poison will prove herself to be a venomous contributor to the team’s overall DPS.</h3>
